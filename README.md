# Unity FPS Controller WIP
A very simple Unity FPS Controller. I made this to learn about Unity game development.

**Features**
- Ability to tweak gun settings to fit different weapons
  - Clip size, fire rate, reload speed, bullet speed, etc...
- Ability to choose between gun variations
  - Single shot weapons, fully automatic weapons, and dual weapons (akimbo style)
- Procedural recoil
  - Also has the ability to customize the recoil
- Procedural ADS
- Weapon sway
- Gun reload positions and gun fire positions
  - Since I didn't use any animations, I changed the positions when certain actions are happening.
  - For the reload, the gun moves down and out of the view before coming back up when finished reloading (All this can be tweaked).
  - For rifles, since its a single shot, I added a rotation to the gun for the bolting action.
